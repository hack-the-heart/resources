This document will give an overview of what Bluemix has to offer.

## Building Apps
-> [Documentation Link](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/docs/)

### Cloud Foundry Applications
Bluemix includes runtimes for Java, Node.js, PHP, Python, Ruby, Go, and available Cloud Foundry community build-packs.

Most likely, you will be using cloud foundry applications. Our starter-app server is based on `node-js` and `Cloudant`. Feel free to check out the other build packs and boiler plate applications [here](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/catalog/#services).
